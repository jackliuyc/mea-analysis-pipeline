Analysis pipeline for MEA EEG analysis.

This notebook provides an example analysis pipeline for resting state MEA or EEG data. This is using a quarto notebook to include both signal processing and stats. Data are processed using mne-python, scipy (version 1.11.3) and mne-connectivity (version 0.5.0). Stats are conducted using R (version 3.4.1) and the rstatix package. Analyses include average band power comparisons, power spectrum analyses, and connectivity analyses.
